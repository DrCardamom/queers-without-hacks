<h1>POC-Only View</h1>

<p>Some POC on Facebook have requested a feature that will make it easier for self-identified People of Color to find other queer POC to date, if they so wish.  In this Facebook thread, they proposed an optional checkbox allowing a user to identify as a POC, which would reveal a second optional checkbox allowing that user to filter their matches to POC-only.</p>

<p>POC-identified collaborators can discuss / modify / critique etc. this feature proposal here.  Collaborators who don't identify as POC are kindly asked to leave this particular discussion to the users who would be affected by the feature.</p>
