<h1>Date Activities Textbox</h1>

<p>Remember at the way beginning of Livejournal, in 2001, when you used to be able to generate a ranking of other users based on your number of shared interests?  And how you also used to be able to click on an interest and see all the people who shared that interest?  Let's bring that back, except instead of "interests," it will be a list of activities that you want to do on a date.</p>

<h3>A fun date includes: {Example: Italian food, art museum, karaoke, spelunking...} </h3>

<p>The opposite of this is an advanced feature, the "Do Not Show Me" textbox.  It would be something like this...</p>

<h3>Don't show me users with these words in their profile: {Example: straight acting, not all men, Ayn Rand ...}</h3>
