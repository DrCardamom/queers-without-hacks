<h1>Monogamy / Polyamory / Etc.</h1>

<p>Relationship Style is a standard matching feature for all users, required like Gender and Zip Code. Users may select as many relationship styles as they wish (including "I don't know."). The application will return a list of users who fit ANY of the listed options.</p>

<p>This will also include 2 OPTIONAL OVERRIDE buttons: don't show me users interested in monogamy / don't show me users interested in polyamory.</p>
