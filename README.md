Queer Open Source Dating. 

<p>We queers are drawing up plans to build an open source queer dating website. This will be a web based application, with possible mobile app development to follow.  Technologies will include Ruby On Rails, CSS/Sass, Javascript, and others TBD.</p> 

<p>The first stage is in English, not in code.  It includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Brainstorming features of the application.</li>
  <li>Discussing user experience and user interfaces.</li>
  <li>Discussing potential data structures.</li>  
  <li>Drafting a Code of Conduct.</li>
  <li>Establishing a set of best practices to guide the project.</li>  
</ul>
