Queer Open Source Dating. 

<p>We queers are drawing up plans to build an open source queer dating website. This will be a web based application, with possible mobile app development to follow.  Technologies will include Ruby On Rails, CSS/Sass, Javascript, and others TBD.</p> 

<p>The first stage is in English, not in code.  It includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Brainstorming features of the application.</li>
  <li>Discussing user experience and user interfaces.</li>
  <li>Discussing potential data structures.</li>  
  <li>Drafting a Code of Conduct.</li>
  <li>Establishing a set of coding/workflow best practices to guide the project.</li>
  <li>Setting up a wiki for non-coder potential users to contribute ideas.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be different from other dating sites, for reasons including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By default, matching is based on complex, modular gender options. (See folder Matchmaking --> Standard Matchmaking Features --> Genders.md)</li>
  <li>An all-queer core dev team (in process of forming), with a prominent trans and/or female dev presence.</li>
  <li>Open-source and UX-driven, accepting multiple ways for users to contribute code and request features.</li>
</ul>
