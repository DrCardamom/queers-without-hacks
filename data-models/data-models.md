### Avi thinks:

* Seems like we're looking at a relational database. A user will be a simple model, but a user's preferences and identity features will be associated with them via many-to-many relationships. This could be complicated... but it also gets us away from binaries.
* In general - what's our operating assumption about 'attraction'? Is the baseline assumption that everyone's attracted to everyone, and we reduce the pool based on specific exclusions? OR is a new user assumed to be attracted to NO ONE until they provide specific info about what they're looking for. An opt-in to specific pools of potential partners.
