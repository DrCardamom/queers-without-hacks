<h3>A Wiki For Non-Techies To Contribute Suggestions and Discuss Features</h3>

<p>Things To Consider</p>

* Clearly mark on each page of the Wiki that this Wiki is NOT the dating site itself, but a place for planning features of the site that does not yet exist (and, once it does exist, link to the url of the real site). (This confusion has caused trouble for other repositories opening input to non-techies.)

* Host the wiki on a very user-friendly interface: (1) easy to sign up (2) doesn't look scary (3) doesn't require any knowledge of html or markdown to contribute.

* At least 2 members of core dev team moderate the wiki, to prevent problems such as trolling, racism, misogyny, queerphobia, transphobia, etc. The devs who take this on should have experience in both UX and moderation / conflict resolution, and this should definitely NOT be two dudes.
