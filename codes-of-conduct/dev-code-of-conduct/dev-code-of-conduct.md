* Development is driven by user stories, as explored in this repo. Primary question for developers should be 'how does this benefit the user'.
* Development need not be Test Driven - but all features should be backed by tests. 
* New features are developed in new feature branches. Nobody pushes to master (hehe...). Develop with a team in a feature branch, write tests, submit pull request, and another team reviews the work before its merged to master branch.
