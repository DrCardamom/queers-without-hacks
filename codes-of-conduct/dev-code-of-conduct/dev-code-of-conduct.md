* Development is driven by user stories, as explored in this repo. Primary question for developers should be 'how does this benefit the user'.
* When working on an advanced feature that specifically serves a subset of the queer population (people of color, people of size, people with disabilities, etc.), members of the target population should have the most prominent voice in the user-experience conversation surrounding that feature. It is time to engineer the feature only after the dev team has heard, understands, and can articulate the UX desires of users from that population.   

* Development need not be Test Driven - but all features should be backed by tests. 
* New features are developed in new feature branches. Nobody pushes to master (hehe...). Develop with a team in a feature branch, write tests, submit pull request, and another team reviews the work before its merged to master branch.

* Professionalism: When getting opinions from potential users, don't argue with the user or defend the project. Just thank the user for their input, add it to the wiki and/or repo (if it's not already there), direct the user to the url where it's being worked on, and invite the user to follow the project.  



### Thoughts about pairing, and imparting knowledge?
